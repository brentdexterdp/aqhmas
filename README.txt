Hi! Welcome to AQHMAS (Air Quality and Heat Monitoring and Alert System)!
This project aims to monitor the air quality (CO2 and PM2.5 levels) and heat index of an area.
The gathered data are then sent to the Thingspeak IoT analytics platform using the ESP8266 module.
The data will be processed using MATLAB and will be presented graphically in the Thingspeak web app.

This project is divided into three modules: 
1. DHT11_Final for the heat index
2. HC8 for CO2
3. PMS9103M for PM2.5.

Collaborators:
